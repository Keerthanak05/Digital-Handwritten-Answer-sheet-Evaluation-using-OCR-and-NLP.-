1. Navigate to Your Project Directory
bash
cd /path/to/your/project

2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
python3 -m venv venv
This will create a folder named venv inside your project.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
bash
source venv/bin/activate
Once activated, you should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

4. Install Required Dependencies
If you have a requirements.txt file:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Otherwise, you can manually install necessary libraries:
bash

pip install opencv-python pytesseract numpy pandas flask
(Modify the package list as per your project needs.)

5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (When Done)
bash
deactivate
